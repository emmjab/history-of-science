It existed for only one year, being split into two parts in 1947, one dealing with physical sciences (Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung A) and the other covering the chemical and biosciences (Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung B). The biosciences were separated in 1973 (Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Naturforschung C), resulting in three successor journals.[1] The three current journals are all considered to begin with the 1946 volume; consequently, all three journals use the same volume number in each calendar year. The publisher typically uses the abbreviation Z. Naturforsch. for all three journals with the part indicated in the volume number. For example, an article in a 2012 issue of Part A might be referenced in some places as being from volume \"67a\" of Z. Naturforsch., but in other places references will show volume \"67\" of \"Z.

As the name implies, it draws aspects from both the studies of neuroscience and genetics, focusing in particular how the genetic code an organism carries affects its expressed traits. Mutations in this genetic sequence can have a wide range of effects on the quality of life of the individual. Neurological diseases, behavior and personality are all aspects of man studied in the context of neurogenetics. The field of neurogenetics emerged in the mid to late 1900s with advances closely following advancements made in available technology.

There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, the effect it has on humans in different situations, etc.[2] Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere,[3][4] just below the stratosphere. Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[5] When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.",
